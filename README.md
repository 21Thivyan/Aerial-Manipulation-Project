# CapstoneProject
This project aims to develop a semi-autonomous robotic arm for drone-based object manipulation. Initially, the system will support manual control, with future integration of autonomous functions using ultrasonic sensors and computer vision.

**Project Scope**
Phase 1: Manual control system implementation.
Phase 2: Autonomous object detection and manipulation.
Phase 3: Optimization and real-world testing.
